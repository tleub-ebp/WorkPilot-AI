"""Audit Trail & Compliance Replay.

Append-only event log with hash chaining (a la Git/blockchain) so any
tampering is detectable. Captures every agent action (who, when, what,
why, what-was-the-input, what-was-the-output) and lets compliance
auditors replay any past decision.

Different from `compliance_collector/` which gathers evidence artefacts
for audit reports — this module is the **immutable source of truth** that
the collector (and anyone else) can consume.
