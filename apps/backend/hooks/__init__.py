"""Pre-commit hooks for WorkPilot AI features.

Three opt-in checks invocable as a single CLI command:

* ``license-check``   — fails on policy violations from the License Scanner
* ``drift-check``     — fails on HIGH/CRITICAL architecture drift vs baseline
* ``gen-tests-check`` — fails on regressions vs the latest test generation

Install manually in ``.git/hooks/pre-commit`` (or via your hook manager
of choice — pre-commit, husky, lefthook). All checks are designed to be
fast (parse-only — they don't run the full scanner unless asked) and to
exit cleanly when their input data is missing (no spurious failures on
fresh checkouts).
